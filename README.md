This project explores business analytics using the Superstore retail dataset. The analysis was conducted in Python through Google Colab, where the data was cleaned, visualized, and used to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs). The main objective was to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and profit patterns to support better business decisions.

Two key insights were found through this analysis. First, the Consumer segment generated the highest total sales and profit, making it the most valuable customer group for the business. Second, the Technology category showed the highest average profit margin compared to other categories, suggesting that products in this category are more efficient and profitable.

Compared to Excel, Python offers several advantages for business analytics. While Excel is more familiar and easier for small datasets, it becomes limited when handling large files or performing advanced tasks. Python, on the other hand, can manage large datasets quickly, automate processes, and create detailed visualizations. Calculating KPIs like profit margin or delivery time in Python is also more efficient and scalable, especially using functions like groupby() and mean().
